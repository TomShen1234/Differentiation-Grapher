Swift Student Challenge 2020 Award Program

This program can help you with basic calculus. 

Features:

- Enter equation, and an x position, and it estimates the first derivatives. (it uses h=0.0000001 so that the computer won't divide by 0)
- Calculates tangent and normal.
- Graphs the original equation, the tangent, and the normal. 
- Drag on graph to inspect on value. 

It uses 1 external library:
